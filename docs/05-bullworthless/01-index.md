# Bullworthless

Bullworthless is a freeroam server for Bully: Scholarship Edition made using derpy's script server.

## Connect

1. Download [derpy's script loader](/docs/miscellaneous/downloads/dsl) and install it using its `readme.txt`.
1. Download the [server browser](/downloads/server_browser.zip) and put the whole unextracted file in `_derpy_script_loader/scripts`.
1. Start the game to let `_derpy_script_loader/config.txt` be generated then open it.
1. Find `allow_networking` and set it to `true`. Also set your `username` to whatever you like.
1. Add list_server `bullyscripting.net:17017` to the config file. This lets the server browser list it.
1. Restart the game for your config to take effect. Open the server browser using `F1`.
1. Use the arrow keys to navigate the browser and hit right to connect.
