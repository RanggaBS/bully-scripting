# Faction Items

Items are desired by different factions. This is how factions are scored at the end of the school year. Each faction has 5 _unique_ items, and 1 _common_ item. They will really want to get all their unique items, but still get as many common items as they can.

A faction's _score_ is calculated using `(unique_count / 5) \* common_count`. This means a faction's common item is their main scoring method, but since it is multiplied by their unique items they will want them all.

All faction items are in the [full list of items](/docs/bullworthless/items#items). The descriptions given here are what shows up in the faction item menu, explaining why the item is important to the faction.
