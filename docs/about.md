# About This Project

**Bully Scripting Docs** is a fan-made documentation site dedicated to making Bully: Scholarship Edition modding easier to understand and build upon.  
It compiles technical information, scripting references, and modding insights into a structured, developer-friendly resource for both beginners and experienced modders.

The project was inspired by the work of **derpy54320**, creator of [**Derpy Script Loader (DSL)**](https://nexusmods.com/bullyscholarshipedition/mods/43) — a cornerstone of modern Bully modding. Her research and tools have set the foundation for countless mods and technical advancements in the community. The official DSL documentation can be found at [snowypuppy.dev/bully](https://snowypuppy.dev/bully).

This site is not an official source, nor is it affiliated with any individual developer. It exists to complement the community’s collective knowledge and provide a centralized, easily accessible reference for scripting and technical exploration.

All documentation shared here is community-driven and maintained with the goal of preserving and expanding the knowledge around Bully’s internal systems, scripting APIs, and modding capabilities.

Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are always welcome — this site grows best when the community grows with it.
