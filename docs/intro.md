# Introduction

Welcome to the central resource for learning and mastering Lua scripting in Bully: Scholarship Edition. This documentation aims to be a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in modifying or creating new content for this classic game using the Lua scripting language.

Whether you're a beginner just starting out, or an experienced modder looking to deepen your knowledge, we hope you find useful information here.

## Help Us Build This Out!

Right now, this documentation is pretty barebones – there's a lot more we want to add! We know tons of functions, cool script examples, and general know-how are still missing.

Feel free to look around at what's here, but if you've got Bully modding experience, we'd love for you to chip in. This whole thing is a community effort, and your contributions will make a huge difference for everyone looking to get into Bully modding.

**So, to all you seasoned modders, Lua scripting gurus for Bully, or anyone who really knows the ins and outs of how this game ticks – we could really use your expertise!**
:::

Your insights, tips, and code examples are exactly what we need to flesh this documentation out. Whether it's explaining how a specific function works, providing useful code snippets, or even sharing your own scripts, every bit of information helps us build a more complete picture.

We're big believers that sharing knowledge is the best way for everyone to learn and for the community to thrive. When you contribute, you're not just helping others out; you might even find it sharpens your own understanding.

Seriously, what you know is gold. By sharing it, you can help newcomers get started, make the whole Bully modding scene richer, and ensure all this awesome knowledge doesn't get lost to time.

If you're interested in lending a hand, please check out how you can contribute (for instance, via this project's GitHub repository, if one is linked, or by getting in touch with the documentation maintainers). Honestly, no contribution is too small, and we'll be super grateful for any help you can offer.
