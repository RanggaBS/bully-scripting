# Days

The reason players attend different classes each day is due to the gameâ€™s internal day system. Unlike a real-world calendar, the game operates on a repeating five-day cycle. This means there are no weekends or regular days off, the player only get a break when all classes for that specific in-game day have been completed.

Known usage in the base game functions:
- [`SetCurrentDay`](/docs/game-reference/global-functions/SetCurrentDay)
- [`GetCurrentDay`](/docs/game-reference/global-functions/GetCurrentDay)
