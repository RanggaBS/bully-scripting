# ClothingRestore

## Description

Changes the player's clothing items to those saved previously with [`ClothingBackup`](https://bully-scripting.vercel.app/docs/game-reference/global-functions/ClothingBackup).
<br/>This does NOT update the player model visually. That requires [`ClothingBuildPlayer`](https://bully-scripting.vercel.app/docs/game-reference/global-functions/ClothingBuildPlayer).

```lua
